# Final Project STA 141B


What I want to do with this project is to be able to get all the restaurants in Davis and than show an data frame of whether the place is closed, the phone number, the rating, the display address, as well as the price. I will also display an word map as well. The main word map where the input is "-" is that it shows an word map of all the reviews of the restaurants in Davis. I put that as the default for all 3 of the -'s in the 3 buttons. After you select the first button of what your price range is, you than select what type of restaurant you would like to eat at. Whether it be American, or a food truck, you would select that. The third button would than show the list of restaurants which fit that category. When you are more specific in your input, it will show the word map of the reviews that people have put down for that specific restaurant. This in particular is actually very helpful to me because I have always struggled with finding a place to eat as well as finding out what customers have to say as well as other factors such as the average reviews, if store is open, and how expensive the store is. I am very happy with this app, while it is simplistic, it very straightforward and people can gain a lot from that simplistic software design. This app makes it very easy to make my choice on food. Unfortunately, the Yelp API doesn't allow more than 50 businesses to show up through the API, thus I was pretty limited as to how much I could put from the dataset, as nto everything was a restaurant as well.Hopefully in the future I can expand it to include other cities such as my hometown Fremont,California or even by counties. An issue I found was that was that the businesses that Yelp returned, were only $, and $$ prices. There werent any in the more expensive options.

All of this data has been produced from the YELP API Developers version.
