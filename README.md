# Final Project STA 141B


What I want to do with this project is to be able to get all the restaurants in Davis and than show an dataframe of whether the place is closed, the phone number, the rating, the display address, as well as the price. I will also display an word map as well. The main word map where the input is "-" is that it shows an wordmap of all the reviews of the restaurants in Davis. When you are more specific in your input, it will show the word map of the reviews that people have put down for that specific restaurant.

All of this data has been produced from the YELP API Developers version.

The final output is at this link: https://amanorsingh1.shinyapps.io/FinalSTA141B/

The full word map of all the reviews of restaurants in Davis.
